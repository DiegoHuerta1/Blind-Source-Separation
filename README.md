# Bllind Source Separation 


This repository contains implementations of blind source separation (BSS) techniques based on various notions of statistical independence, including tools from free probability theory.

Implemented Methods:

* ICA – Independent Component Analysis

* FCA – Free Component Analysis

* BCA – Boolean Component Analysis

* OVFCA – Operator-Valued Free Component Analysis

* Mixed Cumulant Computation – For assessing dependencies between random variables

Features:

* Modular and well-documented code for applying and testing each method

Examples for separating:

* Random vectors

* Images

* Videos

Evaluation tools:

* Visual inspection

* Estimation error of the mixing matrix
